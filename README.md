# Materialize Self-Managed Terraform Modules

---

## About Materialize

Materialize is a real-time data integration platform that creates and continually updates consistent views of transactional data from across your organization. Its SQL interface democratizes the ability to serve and access live data. Materialize can be deployed anywhere your infrastructure runs.

Use Materialize to do things like deliver fresh context for AI/RAG pipelines, power operational dashboards, and create more dynamic customer experiences without building time-consuming custom data pipelines.

The three most common patterns for adopting Materialize are the following:

Query Offload (CQRS) - Scale complex read queries more efficiently than a read replica, and without the headaches of cache invalidation.
Integration Hub (ODS) - Extract, load, and incrementally transform data from multiple sources. Create live views of your data that can be queried directly or pushed downstream.
Operational Data Mesh (ODM) - Use SQL to create and deliver real-time, strongly consistent data products to streamline coordination across services and domains.

## Overview

This repository provides production-ready Terraform modules for deploying Materialize in self-managed environments across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. The modules are designed to be composable, allowing you to use them individually or combine them to build complete infrastructure stacks.

### Architecture

A typical Materialize deployment consists of:

**Cloud Infrastructure Layer:**
- **Networking**: VPC/VNet with private and public subnets, NAT gateways, and network security
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Managed Kubernetes service (EKS, AKS, or GKE) with autoscaling node groups
- **Metadata Store**: Managed PostgreSQL database for Materialize system catalog and metadata
- **Object Storage**: S3/Blob Storage/GCS for Materialize's persistent data layer
- **Load Balancing**: Cloud-native load balancers for exposing Materialize services

**Kubernetes Application Layer:**
- **Materialize Operator**: Kubernetes operator that manages Materialize instances
- **Cert-Manager**: Certificate management for TLS
- **Materialize Instance**: The actual Materialize deployment with configurable resources

## Cloud Provider Support

### AWS

Complete support for deploying Materialize on Amazon Web Services with EKS, RDS PostgreSQL, and S3.

**Key Features:**
- EKS cluster with **Karpenter** for advanced node autoscaling and efficient resource management
- RDS PostgreSQL for metadata storage
- S3 with IRSA for secure, passwordless access
- Network Load Balancer for service exposure
- Multi-AZ deployment support

**Autoscaling:** Uses [Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/docs/), to provision right-sized nodes based on pending pod requirements, offering better bin-packing and faster scale-up compared to cluster autoscaler.

**Get Started:** See [aws/examples/simple/README.md](./aws/examples/simple/README.md) for detailed deployment instructions and architecture.

### Azure

Complete support for deploying Materialize on Microsoft Azure with AKS, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, and Azure Storage.

**Key Features:**
- AKS cluster with Cilium networking
- PostgreSQL Flexible Server for metadata storage
- Azure Storage with Workload Identity federation for secure access
- Azure Load Balancer for service exposure
- Multi-zone deployment support

**Autoscaling:** Uses Azure's native cluster autoscaler that integrates directly with Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets for automated node scaling. In future we are planning to enhance this by making use of [karpenter-provider-azure](https://github.com/Azure/karpenter-provider-azure)

**Get Started:** See [azure/examples/simple/README.md](./azure/examples/simple/README.md) for detailed deployment instructions and architecture.

### GCP

Complete support for deploying Materialize on Google Cloud Platform with GKE, Cloud SQL, and Cloud Storage.

**Key Features:**
- GKE cluster with Workload Identity
- Cloud SQL PostgreSQL for metadata storage
- Cloud Storage with HMAC keys for S3-compatible access
- GCP Load Balancer for service exposure
- Regional deployment support

**Autoscaling:** Uses GKE's native cluster autoscaler that integrates with Google Compute Engine managed instance groups for automated node scaling.

**Get Started:** See [gcp/examples/simple/README.md](./gcp/examples/simple/README.md) for detailed deployment instructions and architecture.

## Unsupported Features & Known Limitations

### GCP Storage Authentication

**Limitation:** Materialize currently only supports HMAC key authentication for GCS access (S3-compatible API).

**Current State:** The modules configure both HMAC keys and Workload Identity, but Materialize uses HMAC keys for actual storage access.

**Future:** Native GCS access via Workload Identity Federation or Kubernetes service account impersonation will be supported in a future release, eliminating the need for static credentials.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Terraform >= 1.0
- Cloud provider credentials configured
- kubectl (for managing Kubernetes resources)
- Appropriate cloud provider CLI tools (aws-cli, az, or gcloud)

### Quick Start

1. **Choose your cloud provider** and navigate to the example directory

    `cd <cloud-provider>/examples/simple`
2. **Review the example README** for cloud-specific prerequisites and configuration
3. **Instantiate modules in your terraform stack**.

    The examples are just that: examples. They aren't meant for you to run directly, but to serve as something to base your own module instantiations on.
4. **Set required variables** in a `terraform.tfvars` file
5. **Deploy the infrastructure:**

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
**Get the mz_system password**

```bash
> terraform output -raw external_login_password_mz_system

````
**Increase the cluster size for mz_catalog_server**

```
ALTER CLUSTER mz_catalog_server SET (SIZE = '50cc')
```

4. **Connect to your Materialize instance** using the connection details from the Terraform outputs

### Module Usage

All modules can be used independently. For example, if you already have a Kubernetes cluster, you can use just the Materialize-specific modules:

```hcl
module "materialize_instance" {
  source               = "github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize-terraform-self-managed//kubernetes/modules/materialize-instance?ref=<tag>"
  instance_name        = "production"
  instance_namespace   = "materialize"
  metadata_backend_url = "postgres://user:pass@host/db"
  persist_backend_url  = "s3://bucket-name/prefix"
  # ... additional configuration
}
```

Set the `ref=` portion to point at the latest tagged version of this repository.

## Destory an existing environment 
```
cd azure/examples/simple
terraform workspace list
terraform workspace select default
```
select 'default' or the correct workspace 

```
terraform plan -destroy -var-file "terraform.tfvars" -out "destroy.tfplan"
```
Review destroy.tfplan carefully (redirect to a file and grep if it's large — the chat/tool output can truncate from the start on huge plans).

Apply the destroy
```
terraform apply "destroy.tfplan"
```


## Upgrading

Most of the time, you just need to bump the `ref=<tag>` in all modules. We recommend that you bump all modules to the same version in the same `terraform apply`. We frequently make changes that assume related changes in dependent modules.

Upgrades of the materialize version are included in our tagged releases. We do not recommend overriding the Materialize version, orchestratord version, or helm chart version. Updating the module tags will automatically pick up the latest versions of these components.

We follow semantic versioning with our tags. If a particular version requires additional actions or contains breaking changes, we will list them below.

### Upgrade Notes

#### v8.0.0

The GCP modules now require the `hashicorp/google` provider `>= 7.22, < 8` (previously `>= 6.31, < 6.51.0`). This is required by the upgrade of the upstream `terraform-google-modules/sql-db/google` module to v28, which no longer supports google provider 6.x.

**Impact on existing deployments:**

- `terraform init -upgrade` is required to install the 7.x provider and update your lockfile. If your root module has other provider constraints capping `hashicorp/google` below 7.x, init will fail until those are raised as well.
- This crosses the google provider 6.x → 7.x major version boundary. The modules in this repository do not use any of the fields removed in 7.0, but if you manage additional GCP resources in the same configuration, review the [google provider 7.0 upgrade guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/version_7_upgrade) for changes affecting them.
- Run `terraform plan` against your existing state before applying and review any unexpected diffs introduced by the provider upgrade.

#### v7.0.0

The GCP `networking` module now requires a list of strings rather than a single string for `var.routes.tags`.

#### v6.0.0

The AWS `karpenter-nodepool` module no longer hardcodes `terminationGracePeriod: 300s` on Karpenter NodePools. A new `termination_grace_period` variable controls it and defaults to `null` (unset).

With a `terminationGracePeriod` set, Karpenter replaces drifted nodes (for example, after changing the node pool's instance types) even when pods carry the `karpenter.sh/do-not-disrupt` annotation — the annotation and PDBs only delay eviction until the node's termination deadline. Materialize instance pods were therefore force-evicted about 5 minutes after any node pool change. With it unset, do-not-disrupt pods block disruption until a Materialize rollout moves them.

The AWS examples now set `termination_grace_period = "300s"` on the generic pool (matching the previously hardcoded value; its workloads tolerate eviction) and leave it unset on the materialize pool.

**Impact on existing deployments:**

Karpenter stamps `terminationGracePeriod` into each NodeClaim when the node is created and never updates it afterwards; changing the NodePool only marks existing nodes as Drifted. Existing materialize nodes were created with `300s` baked in, so the first `terraform apply` that changes the NodePool template (including removing `terminationGracePeriod`) drift-replaces them, and their baked-in deadline bypasses do-not-disrupt one final time. Materialize pods restart with a short interruption.

If a one-time restart of your Materialize instances is acceptable, bump `ref=<tag>` and apply. The replacement nodes are created without `terminationGracePeriod`, and node pool changes from then on respect do-not-disrupt.

To migrate without downtime, keep the old pool's template unchanged and move pods to a new pool first, similar to the GCP node pool migration in v5.0.0:

1. Bump `ref=<tag>` on all modules, and set `termination_grace_period = "300s"` on your existing materialize nodepool module instance. This matches the value the module previously hardcoded, so the NodePool template is unchanged and no nodes drift. Keep the generic pool at `"300s"` (as the examples do) and its nodes don't drift either.
2. `terraform apply`. There should be no changes to the `termination_grace_period` on the node pools.
3. Add a second materialize nodepool module instance with a new `name` (for example `materialize2`), the same `nodeclass_name`, labels, and taints, but `termination_grace_period` should be unset.
4. `terraform init && terraform apply` to create the new NodePool. It has no nodes yet.
5. Prevent the old NodePool from provisioning new nodes by setting `limits = { cpu = "0" }` on the old materialize nodepool module instance. Limits are not part of the NodePool template, so this does not drift the existing nodes.
6. `terraform apply` to cap the old NodePool. Do this before cordoning: if the pool were still uncapped when its nodes are cordoned, any pending pods could cause Karpenter to provision fresh (uncordoned) nodes from the old pool.
7. Cordon the old pool's nodes so the rollout's new pods cannot be scheduled onto them. Cordoning only blocks new scheduling; the pods already running there are unaffected:

   ```bash
   kubectl cordon -l karpenter.sh/nodepool=materialize
   ```
8. Prepare a rollout of your Materialize instances by setting the `force_rollout` field to a new UUID. If you have reverted to the `v1alpha1` version of the Materialize CRD, also set `request_rollout` to the same UUID.
9. `terraform apply` to perform the rollout. The old pool's nodes are cordoned and the pool is capped, so Karpenter provisions capacity from the new pool for the new-generation pods.
10. Verify the new environmentd and clusterd pods are running on the new pool's nodes. Once the old nodes are empty, Karpenter consolidates them away (`WhenEmpty`, after 60s); cordoning does not block this.
11. Remove the old nodepool module instance (with its `termination_grace_period = "300s"` pin and `limits` cap) from your configuration.
12. `terraform apply` to delete the old NodePool.

#### v5.0.0

The GCP examples default to new machine types for higher performance and due to capacity constraints with the previous types:

- Generic node pool: `e2-standard-8` → `c4-standard-8`
- Materialize node pool: `n2-highmem-8` → `c4a-highmem-8-lssd` (Arm-based; local SSDs are bundled, so `local_ssd_count` is now 2)
- Cloud SQL: `db-custom-2-4096` → `db-custom-N4-2-4096` with `HYPERDISK_BALANCED` disk (N4 does not support `PD_SSD`)

The nodepool module gained a `disk_type` variable. C4 and C4A only support Hyperdisk boot disks, and an existing node pool keeps its old disk type when the machine type changes, so set `disk_type = "hyperdisk-balanced"` (the examples now do) when moving to these machine types.

**Impact on existing deployments:**

These changes are for the examples. You are not required to change your existing infrastructure at this time, but future testing and performance profiling will be done using the newer machine and disk types. As such, we recommend updating your configuration at your convenience.

- **Node pools**: Do not change the machine type on an existing materialize node pool. Instead, migrate blue-green:
  1. Bump `ref=<tag>` on all modules, keeping your existing machine types, `disk_type`, and database tier unchanged. The tag bump alone doesn't modify existing node pools (`disk_type` defaults to `null`), and it makes the new `disk_type` variable available for the next step. Don't set `disk_type` on the old pool — Hyperdisk is not supported on the older machine series.
  2. Add a new nodepool module instance with the new machine type and `disk_type` (use a new `prefix` so the pool gets a distinct name), keeping the old pool unchanged. For a swap-enabled pool, also set a distinct `disk_setup_name` (e.g. `disk-setup-v2`) — it names the disk-setup namespace and daemonset, which otherwise collide with the old pool's. Also update the `local_ssd_count` for the new instance type (`c4a-highmem-8-lssd` has 2, for example).
  3. `terraform apply` to create the new node pool.
  4. Add a decommission taint to the old pool's `node_taints`, for example:

     ```hcl
     node_taints = [
       # ... existing taints ...
       {
         key    = "materialize.cloud/decommissioned"
         value  = "true"
         effect = "NO_SCHEDULE"
       }
     ]
     ```

     Taints update in place (no pool replacement) on the provider versions these modules require. Running pods are not evicted, but no new pods schedule to the old pool, and the cluster autoscaler will not scale it up for pending pods, since they don't tolerate the taint. Use a taint key the Materialize pods don't tolerate (not `materialize.cloud/workload` or `kubernetes.io/arch`).
  5. `terraform apply` to apply the decommision taint to the old pool.
  6. Prepare a rollout of your Materialize instances by setting the `force_rollout` field to a new UUID. If you have reverted back into the `v1alpha1` version of the Materialize CRD, also set `request_rollout` to the same UUID.
  7. `terraform apply` to perform the rollout.
  8. Verify the new environmentd and clusterd pods are only scheduled onto the new pool.
  9. Remove the old nodepool module instance from your configuration.
  10. `terraform apply` to delete the old pool.
- **Cloud SQL**: Do **not** adopt the new tier and disk type on an existing instance. `disk_type` changes force instance replacement, which destroys the Materialize metadata database, and Cloud SQL reserves deleted instance names for up to a week, so the recreate also fails with a 409. Keep existing instances pinned to their current tier (`db-custom-2-4096`) and disk type (`PD_SSD`); the N4 default is for new deployments only.

C4, C4A, and N4 are not available in every region. Verify availability in your region before upgrading, or keep the previous types.

#### v4.0.0

Default to v1 of the Materialize CRD.

Changes will be rolled out immediately, without needing to update the `request_rollout` variable.

#### v3.0.0

Kubernetes version 1.34.

#### v2.0.0

Kubernetes version 1.33.
